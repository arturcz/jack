    <TD>Another release (3.1.1) aimed at fixing the nasty curses-bugs. Plugins
    are back (see the examples). The help-box now stays on top unless you
    press "?" or disable it (see manpage).
<TR><TD valign=top>28-Nov-2004
    <TD>Just over one year, again. Jack-3.1.0 is out. Lots of bugs fixed, most
    notably the curses addstr() problem. Options can now be set with
    --option=value, like in --various=yes. Your old config files should still
    work but I recommend rebuilding them. Here's the full <A
    href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</A>. Most documentation is years old, only
    the manpage is quite up to date.
<TR><TD valign=top>12-Oct-2003
    <TD>After just over one year in development, today I bring you Jack-3.0.0.
    Rejoice! =) Jack is now split up into lots of tiny modules which load
    faster because of python's precompilation and are also easier to maintain
    for me. The config-file is now ~/.jack3rc and (optionally) /etc/jackrc for
    site-wide stuff. You don't edit your rc-files now, instead you can specify
    some options and let jack --save them for you. Old ~/.jackrc files are not
    touched or read so please plan for some configuration time after updating.
    What else is new...  hm, let me see... real ID3v2 support with pyid3lib,
    fixes and patches from various sources... quite a lot. But I didn't get
    much feedback on the development versions so I can't (of course) guarantee
    that all that worked before does so now. Please tell me if there are any
    problems.
<TR><TD valign=top>02-Sep-2002
    <TD>Work on jack-3.0 started a few days ago. Will appear in CVS soon.
<TR><TD valign=top>02-Sep-2002
    <TD>Jack 2.99.9 released. This is a rather strange release. It's the last
        release before 3.0.0. I wanted to release the last "stable" version,
        before my work on the 3.0.0 release. But all changes are older than
        2 months. <B>I did not test it before releasing</B>, but everything
        should be fine. In the unlikely case that it doesn't work for you,
        I won't fix it. You'd have to wait for the first 3.0 release or
        stick with 2.99.8. Here are the main changes:<PRE>
- jack can use normal curses now (to the extent possible, i.e.
	without reacting to SIGWINCH (terminal window resizing))

- added sloppy ripping mode which is activated by a secret switch

- added support for MPEGplus (encoder: mppenc, extension: .mpc)

- --quality switch for vbr

- FLAC support

- new char_filter
</PRE>
<TR><TD valign=top>15-Apr-2002
    <TD>Jack 2.99.8 released. All bugs fixed, some improvements.
<TR><TD valign=top>07-Nov-2001
    <TD>Jack 2.99.7 released. Works now with python-2.1.x, please update, everybody ;). If you used jack before, you need to update your .jackrc. Many cleanups, see <A href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</A>.
<TR><TD valign=top>11-Oct-2001
    <TD>Jack 2.99.6 released. Added Ogg/Vorbis support, renamed cursesmodule to jack_cursesmodule (this avoids conflicts) and cleaned up a bit. If things don't work after updating, reinstall and remove your .jackrc.
<TR><TD valign=top>09-Oct-2001
    <TD>If all goes well, jack will get into Debian (unstable, for now) soon. We have to thank Michael Banck for this. In the mean time you can get the packages there: [Update: jack is in Debian unstable and testing now.]
<TR><TD valign=top>05-Oct-2001
    <TD>Jack 2.99.5 released. All that applies to the CVS version is also true for
	this one, so read on below! I will now start to work on <A href="http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/">Ogg Vorbis</A> support.
<TR><TD valign=top>31-Aug-2001
    <TD>Jack 2.99.5 is in CVS now. This version requires
    <A href=http://cddb-py.sourceforge.net>CDDB.py</A> in addition to
    <A href=http://id3-py.sourceforge.net>ID3.py</A> which is no longer bundled
    with Jack. The cursesmodule is now much easier to install thanks to the
    <A href=http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/>Python Distutils-SIG</A>
    which you may have to install.
<TR><TD valign=top>11-May-2000
    <TD>Finally Jack is hosted on <A href=http://jack.sourceforge.net><IMG src=http://sourceforge.net/sflogo.php?group_id=5557&type=1 alt=SourceForge></A>.
<TR><TD valign=top>10-Jan-2000
    <TD>New Version (2.99.0-pre) "ain't it dead yet". I'm about to do some major
    restructuring on Jack, i.e. breaking it up into modules, so the
    installation has changes slightly. Read INSTALL. Cdparanoia 9.7 is now
    supported, so is xingmp3enc (the latter being untested). You can now use
    a local freedb dir. Yes, all bugs fixed, especially those concerning
    the image-reader. TOC file reading has been completely rewritten, it
    is now 100% bug-free (as if). Please, everybody try this version and
    gimme some feedback.
<TR><TD valign=top>05-Nov-1999
    <TD>New Version (2.2.5-pre). Still no documentation updates. Fixes
	2.2.4's renaming bug. Doh.
<TR><TD valign=top>04-Nov-1999
    <TD>New Version (2.2.4-pre). No documentation updates (again). Two bugs
	fixed, one newly introduced. "desperate" mode for those who can't get curses mode to work.
	Jack now has 3333 lines of code.
<TR><TD valign=top>04-Nov-1999
    <TD>New Version (2.2.3-pre). No documentation updates (again). Reintroduced
	free space checking by calling df for all those (RedHat?) users who
	had an error with statvfs. Whoever built those rpms should be punished.
	rename_underscore has been replaced by something more flexible, now you
	can replace characters by multiple characters (like "&auml;" to "ae"),
	kill characters from the filename to be used and, of course, replace
	those spaces by underlines.
	New DAE tools: cdda2wav (finally!) and dagrab (untested as it doesn't
	like my Plextor). All bug fixed, of course.
<TR><TD valign=top>22-Oct-1999
    <TD>New Version (2.2.2-pre). If you get an error like
        "AttributeError: TIOCWINSZ", try this version. It is shipped
        with 2.2.0 documentation as I didn't have time to update it yet.
        Changes: all bugs fixed :), new features. Wait for the final version
        for details.
<TR><TD valign=top>19-Aug-1999
    <TD>New Version (2.2.0). New curses mode, looks much better, scroll
        through the status screen if it doesn't fit in your terminal.
        I recommend not to use XTermset any longer as it is no longer needed.
        The usual bugfixes are there, too, check the
        <A href="CHANGELOG">changelog</A>.
<TR><TD valign=top>18-Aug-1999
    <TD>I really want to add support for the Xing encoder. Does anyone want to pay the registration fee for me? It's only $19 I think.
<TR><TD valign=top>09-Aug-1999
    <TD>New Version (2.1.0), all bugs fixed (of course!), new features like
        on-the-fly operation.
<TR><TD valign=top>19-Jul-1999
    <TD>Big OOPS. Version 2.0.0 contained (at least) two "brown paper bag" bugs:
        first, Jack tried to chdir into newly created dirs twice (one time too
        much), this gets you the "could not create or change to..." error.
        Second, the dirs were created in the wrong sequence, so instead
        of "artist/album" you get "album/artist". Upgrade to 2.0.1, get it
        from the <A href="download.html">download page</A>.
<TR><TD valign=top>16-Jul-1999
    <TD>None of the beta testers complained, so I released version 2.0.0.
        Much has changed, most notably I restructured the beast a bit so that
        Jack no longer needs threads. It's now much easier to get it to work.
        Jack should (finally!) run on FreeBSD and most other unices.
        Jack can now create (and name according to freedb data) directories.
<TR><TD valign=top>01-Jul-1999
    <TD>Released version 1.3.5. Support for tosha(gettoc&DAE) has been added,
        a few non-critical bugs have been fixed.
<TR><TD valign=top>29-Jun-1999
    <TD>Released version 1.3.4. Version 1.3.3 contained a bug where it could
        wrongly claim that you inserted the wrong CD if track 01 doesn't start
        at block 0. The TOC file format changed, too, so better have them
        re-generated.
</TR>
<TR><TD valign=top>27-Jun-1999
    <TD>Released version 1.3.3. see the <A href="CHANGELOG">changelog</A> for details
</TR>
<TR><TD>
    <TD>rearranged the pages a bit. I know the layout still sux, if <B>you</B> have time to waste, let me know.

<H3>What's it all about?</H3>
Jack has been developed with one main goal: making MP3s<I> without having to
worry</I>. There is nearly no way that an incomplete rip goes unnotices, e.g. Jack
compares WAV and MP3 filesizes when continuing from a previous run. Jack also
checks your HD space before doing anything (even keeps some MB free).
<P>
You can take a <A href=screen.html>look</A> at Jack working, there are even some explanations.
<P>
Jack is different from other such tools in a number of ways:
<UL>
<LI>it is written in <A href=http://www.python.org>python</A>

<LI>it is <I>very</I> configurable, maybe too much :)

<LI>it doesn't need X (but is better with it)

<LI>it can "rip" virtual CD images like the ones created by <A
href=http://www.ping.de/sites/daneb/cdrdao.html>cdrdao</A>

<LI>when using cdparanoia, cdparanoia's status information is displayed for all
tracks, so you can see if something went wrong (I consider this very important
- no one wants uncorrected errors or skips to go into one's MP3s. 'Tis the main
  reason why I don't use something beautiful like <A
href=http://www.ling.ed.ac.uk/~oliphant/grip/>grip</A>)

<LI>it allows for overlapping ripping / encoding: when the first track has been
ripped, it's encoder is started as well as the second track's ripping process,
this "read-ahead" is of course configurable, you can have it read the whole CD
and start with the next one as the first one is beeing encoded

<LI>in on-the-fly mode, no WAVs have to be created, less space is wasted. I only recommend this if your encoder is nearly as fast as your ripper.

<LI>it uses sophisticated disk space management, i.e. it schedules it's ripping
/ encoding processes depending on available space. Jack tells you if the batch
will not fit on your HD. If you want, you can have it choose the optimal
sequence of tracks - great if you're low on HD space

<LI>freedb query, file renaming and id3 tagging - I know that this alone is not
special, but Jack tries hard to recognize artist and title when working on a
"Various Artists"-CD, so that the ID3 tag can be set correctly.

<LI>it can resume work after it has been interrupted. If all tracks have been
ripped, it doesn't even need the CD anymore, even if you want to do a freedb
query. In practice, this means that you can change the CD and start another
instance of Jack.

<LI>it can do a freedb query based on MP3s alone, like if you don't remember
from which CD those MP3s came from.

</UL>

Of course, all other "obvious" features are included, too:
<UL>
<LI>being <A href=gpl.txt>GPL</A>'ed

<LI>different rippers and encoders are supported

<LI>freedb submissions

<LI>proxy support via http_proxy environment variable (e.g. export http_proxy=http://cache.sld.tld:3128/)

</UL>
